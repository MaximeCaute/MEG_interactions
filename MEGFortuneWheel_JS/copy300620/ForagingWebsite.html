        Click through the task instructions using the buttons at the bottom.
      </div>
      <div id="t1" class="instrTextsClass">
        In this study, you will play 100 rounds of the 'Lucky wheel' game. Your goal is to win as many points as possible.
        These points will later be translated into money.
        <br/> The counter at the bottom of the screen (blue arrow) shows your total points won so far.
      </div>
      <div id="t2" class="instrTextsClass">
        In each round, you will see a ‘lucky wheel’ (blue arrow).
        <br/>The numbers on the segments of the wheel tell you how many points they are worth. The size of the segment shows how likely it is that the spinner will land there.
        <br/>What you have to do is to decide whether to bank the ‘current win’ (shown in the top right of the screen) by clicking on 'Bank win'.
        <br/> Or whether you want to try your luck and spin the ‘lucky wheel’.
        <br/> You can only make your selection after 3-6 seconds; before that the buttons will be disabled (greyed out). Take as long as you need to make your choice.
      </div>
      <div id="t3" class="instrTextsClass">
        Let's look at what happens if you choose to <b>bank the win</b>.
      </div>
      <div id="t4" class="instrTextsClass">
        If you choose to <b> bank the win</b>, it will get added to your total points and you can move on to the next round.
      </div>
      <div id="t5" class="instrTextsClass">
        Instead, you can also choose to <b> Spin again</b>.
      </div>
      <div id="t6" class="instrTextsClass">
        If you click on <b>spin again</b>, the points listed in red as ‘cost to spin’ will be subtracted from your total points.
        <br/> Then an arrow will start spinning in the middle of the wheel.
        When it lands on one of the pie segments, this will be your new ‘current win’.
        <br/> Every time you spin the wheel, the number of ‘remaining spins’ (in green on the bottom right) will be reduced.
      </div>
      <div id="t7" class="instrTextsClass">
        Note how even before the very first spin of each round there is already a 'current win' that you could choose to bank.
        <br/> Or alternatively, you can decide to 'spin again'.
      </div>
      <div id="t8" class="instrTextsClass">
        Either read these instructions again, or proceed to 6 practice rounds.

    <p style="text-align:left"><strong>1. Background and aims of the study</strong><br>

      The primary aim of this study is find out more about how people learn from feedback and how this relates to
      people’s personality traits and mood. We hope that a better understanding of these processes will, in the
      future, contribute to the development of new approaches to improve mental wellbeing.<br><br>

      This study is funded by the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust.<br><br>

      <strong>2. Why have I been invited to take part? </strong><br>

      You have been invited because you have responded to an advert for this study. To take part in this
      study, you need to be between 18 and 40 years old. You also need to have normal or corrected to
      normal vision and hearing.<br><br>

      <strong>3. Do I have to take part? </strong><br>

      No.  You can ask questions about the study before deciding whether or not to participate by emailing
      the principal researcher (address details below). If you do agree to participate, you may withdraw yourself
      from the study at any time, without giving a reason and without penalty. <br><br>

      <strong>4. What will happen in the study? </strong><br>

      If you are happy to take part in the study, you will be asked to perform a simple computer task such as
      rating pictures estimating a time interval, estimating how well you have performed on the computer task.
      You will then be asked to complete questionnaires that will measure psychological traits and potential
      psychiatric symptoms (e.g. it will ask you questions about whether or not you experience low mood or anxiety).<br><br>

      This should take approximately 1h-1h30min.<br>
      The study will take place online. <br>
      There will not be any follow-up sessions.<br><br>

      <strong>5. Are there any potential risks in taking part? </strong><br>

      Psychological and/or psychiatric questionnaires may be perceived as distressing or intrusive. If you
      experience significant distress as a result of the questionnaires, you can immediately stop the study by
      clicking on the ‘Exit Study Now’ button without giving a reason and without penalty. In this case you
      will still be reimbursed for your time in the study so far.<br><br>

      <strong>6. Are there any benefits in taking part? </strong><br>

      There will be no direct benefit to you from taking part in this research. You will not receive results or
      psychiatric/psychological assessments from the questionnaires. <br><br>

      <strong>7. Expenses and payments </strong><br>

      You will be reimbursed for your time in the study via the third party website administering the study.
      You will receive £5 per hour and a flexible bonus depending on the choices you make in the online task
      (up to £7 per hour overall payment).<br><br>

      <strong>8. What happens to the data provided? </strong><br>

      The anonymous research data will be stored confidentially using password-protected computers and
      servers. We will not store any data that can identify you (e.g. we will not ask your for your email address
      or store your IP address). Although every reasonable effort will be taken, confidentiality during actual
      Internet communication procedures cannot be guaranteed. Terms of use and privacy policies relevant
      to the third-party website in use should be consulted.<br><br>

      <strong>Note: Anonymity may make it very difficult or impossible to withdraw
        data retroactively from the study after completing part or all of an online session.</strong><br><br>

        Anonymized data will be published open access as part of the publication of the research to facilitate its use in future research.<br><br>

        All research data and records will be stored for a minimum retention period of 3 years after publication or public release of the work of the research. The third-party website administering the study may store data on backups or server logs beyond the time frame of this research project.<br><br>

        <strong>Will the research be published?</strong><br>

        The research will be published in peer-reviewed journal.<br><br>

        <strong>Who has reviewed this study?</strong><br>

        This study has been reviewed by, and received ethics clearance through, the University of Oxford Central University Research Ethics Committee <strong>(reference number: R54722/RE001).</strong><br><br>
